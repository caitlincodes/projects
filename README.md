Guided Project: Exploring Hacker News Posts

A data analysis guided project by Datauest, in which the posts from the website Hacker News is being analyzed. The focus lies on submitted stories by users and their comments. From the dataset, we are interested in the posts that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN titles. The dataset has already been cleaned, sorted and reduced to approx. 20,000 rows.

In this project we try to answer the following question:<br>
What is the top 100 keywords of Hacker News posts in 2014?
